# FITA - Far-edge IoT device mAnagement

**FITA** (Far-edge IoT device mAnagement) is a framework that **integrates Far-edge IoT device in Kubernetes**, allowing them to be part of the Kubernetes orchestration and lifecycle monitoring procedures. **Far-edge IoT devices** in the context of FITA **are** the devices **equipped with sensors and actuators** that sense and act in the environment in which they are installed. Additionally, these devices are composed of microcontrollers, which **do not have enough resources to run the Kubernetes Kubelet**.
